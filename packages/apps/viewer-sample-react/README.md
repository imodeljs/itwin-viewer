# React Viewer Sample

This app is an example of using the iTwin Viewer in a modularized React application.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Configuration

Prior to running or building the application, you should update the environment variables in the .env file as needed. This should include adding a valid contextId and iModelId as well as updating the authorization client and backend configuration as needed.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `rushx start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `rushx build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
